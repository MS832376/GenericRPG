# GenericRPG
Take control of a young character ready to set off on the journey of a lifetime. You will start your journey in a town that has long been fending off the terrors looming outside their walls, and it is your job to help them. Gather the magic starter sword, the protective shield, and go conquer the zombies threatening the town!

GenericRPG Notes:

This is my first attempt at a more open 3D game experience. The story is fairly linear with some opportunity for creativity given to the player concerning the order tasks are completed in.

TO BE ADJUSTED:

-"Demo Complete" Requirements

-Final check for Spelling/Grammar

TO BE ADDED:

-Questline to get the shield

-Treaure sidequest(s) (Ex. Find precursor orbs in Jak n Daxter, or the red coins in Super Mario 64)


TO BE CONSIDERED:

-In game economy

-A lot of animations (Zombie Death, Sword Attack, Jump/SprintJump Variations)


The code is updated faster than the posted version, but I am including all the necessary files so if you are incredibly desperate to play the most up to date version of this masterpiece nothing is truly stopping you.
